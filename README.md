<h1 align="center">Steam Transport for Riptide Networking</h1>

A transport for [Riptide Networking](https://github.com/RiptideNetworking/Riptide) that uses [SteamNetworkingSockets](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets).

For a list of other available transports, see the [transports](https://github.com/RiptideNetworking/Riptide#low-level-transports) section of Riptide's main README.

## Dependencies

You must have both [Riptide Networking](https://github.com/RiptideNetworking/Riptide) and [Steamworks.NET](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET) installed and set up before you can use this transport.

## Limitations

Only works on platforms supported by Steam.

## Donate

Riptide and its transports are 100% free to use, but if you'd like to financially support Riptide's development and get early access to new features, you can do so through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/tom-weiland).
